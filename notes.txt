Libraries:
	glfw: cross platform stuff
	glee: open gl extension
	opengl: 800 lb gorilla

opengl pipline:
	primitives:
		points, lines, triangles, triangle strips,
		triangle fans, quads, quadstrips, 

	in games, you almost always use triangles.
		tris -> p1, p2, p3, three points per tri
		tristrips -> p1, p2, p3, 3 points for first
			tri, one additional point per additional tri.
		quads - 4 points per quad
		quadstrips -
		tri fan, 1 point defines initial point, additional
		points define fan edge

	old fixed pipeline:

	primitives -> transform/clip/cull ->
			rasterization  ->
			lighting ->
			fog??? ->
			framebuffer


	new programable pipeline:

		primitives ->
		vertex shader ->
